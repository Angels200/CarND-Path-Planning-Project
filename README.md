# CarND-Path-Planning-Project

## Introduction
The purpose of the Path Planning Project is to solve the problem of self-driving car in a virtual highway by smoothing it. This leads us to answer the following issues :

1. Smoothing the existing waypoints
2. Generating minimum jerk trajectories based on a minimal set of controls
3. Determining the best action based on model cost analysis
